## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div class="main">
                <span class="text">WE ARE CREATIVES</span>
                <a href="#content"><img src="./assets/icon-arrow-down.svg" class="arrow" alt="arrow button"></a>
 </div>
```

```css
.main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-grow: 1;
}

```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks FlexBox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped in finally understaning flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand all concepts. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning hltml-css.
